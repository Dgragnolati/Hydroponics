R Pi Program to run two outlet switch (yes, OVERKILL) but wanted wifi so I could change settings etc without having to set up a bunch of other things... 

Goal is to have each plug run at a set time for a known(ish) duration we are not talking Âµs here.


Plug 1 - Runs a pump that feeds water to the system (hydroponics) CAD to be loaded at some other point in time maybe. 

Plug 2 - Runs grow lamps above the plants

Currently using a PhotoBooth hat made for another project (Design files maybe loaded at another date.
